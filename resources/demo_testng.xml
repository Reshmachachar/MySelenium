1.What is the TestNG xml file?
Ans> 1.it is a configuration file which contains the test execution details.
     2.Test details means 
             1:test execution flow,
             2:in which sequence you want to execute your test cases
             3:what are the test cases you want to execute..   

2.What is the need of TestNG xml file?
Answer>Eg.,if there are some classes like A,B,C,D and 
       their respective methods like A->a1,a2,a3,a4

                                     c->c1,c2,c3
                                     d->d1,d2
       And if you want to run the methods like a2,b1,c3,d2.
