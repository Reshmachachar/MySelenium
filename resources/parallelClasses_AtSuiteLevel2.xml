  1.Suite Level parallel execution is applicable for all the test cases.
  **Execution Process of Parallel Execution. 
  2.If it is  Suite Level parallel execution of classes then,
     1.Mentioned thread(2) are created for first test case,
     2.After execution of first test case then threads are destroyed and
     3.New Mentioned threads(2) are created for next test case.
       here in the test2 there are only one class,
       one thread is used and another one will be idle.
       
     4.Conclusion:At Suite Level
         1.if parallel="classes/methods" =>
           1.No. of threads(mentioned 2) are created per test cases.
           2.that means thread-count*no.of test cases.
           
         1.if parallel="tests" =>
            1.Only 2 threads are created because thread-count is 2.
            2.Means Only assigned thread-count is created.
              
           
              
       
  3.If it is  Suite Level parallel execution of methods then,
